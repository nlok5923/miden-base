# Overview
This documentation presents detailed guides on:

* [Getting started](getting-started.md)
* [Architecture](../architecture.md)
* [Network design](../network.md)
* [Roadmap](../roadmap.md)
* [Cryptographic primitives](../crypto-primitives.md)

**Getting started** provides an hands-om guide on how builders can use our **testnet**.

**Architecture** describes Miden's unique state and execution model - an actor-based model with concurrent off-chain state.

**Network design** describes how the architecture is implemented into a zero-knowledge rollup. It describes the software components, RPC interfaces of the Miden Nodes and Cliets.  

**Roadmap** shows the timeline for user facing features that users can expect.

**Cryptographic primitives** provides an in-depth description of the primitives used in the Miden rollup and the Miden VM.
